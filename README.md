Chalkboard Quiz May 13, 2020

I'm seriously redesigning and developing new features for my Trivia/Quiz game that I have been developing over the years.
The nice thing now is I don't have to go to the Github website as I can now do everything on my iMac computer. This game has 
taught me new coding techniques and has sharpen my design skills. I eventually want to put this on Facebook as I feel this 
game will be fun to play once I get the new features added to it, plus it should be educational as well. So stay tune for further
updates to Chalkboard Quiz.
